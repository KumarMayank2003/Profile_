<h1>About Me: </h1>
<h2>Myself: Kumar Mayank</h2>
<p> I am a driven, self-motivated computer science student seeking opportunities to apply my strong foundation in core CS topics like algorithms, data structures, and OOP to take on complex programming challenges. Through perseverance and time management I earned a 91.6% in my intermediate exams. At BIT Mesra, I look forward to excelling academically, taking on leadership roles, and collaborating with talented peers on boundary-pushing projects that expand my skills.</p> 
<p>Outside of classes, I stay up-to-date on the latest CS advancements through online courses and hackathons. I continually strive to write more efficient code and become a well-rounded programmer able to tackle adaptable problem-solving. My passions are using technology to drive innovation and make a positive community impact.</p>
<p>As I look ahead to my career after graduation in 2026, I am focused on soaking up all the CS knowledge I can. I appreciate any feedback from my connections on improving my skills and experiences. You can find me playing chess, volunteering locally, or brushing up on my native Hindi and professional working English proficiency.</p>
